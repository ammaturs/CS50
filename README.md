# FIFTYVILLE
#### Description: 
Fiftyville was an assignment I worked on during the CS50: Intro to Computer Science course. I was given a database which stored information regarding a (fictional) crime
that occured and tasked with finding who commited the crime. Tables within the database can be seen in the "holder.sql" file.
